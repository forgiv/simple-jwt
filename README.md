# Simple JWT

A VERY basic JWT implementation for those that just want a basic HS256 JWT token.  
The motiviation for this project was too learn about making JWT tokens in Go, and also because the lalternatives are all just a little too complicated when I want a quick and dirty setup.

You probably shouldn't use this library in production.
